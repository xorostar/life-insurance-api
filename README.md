# Life Insurance Recommendation MVP â€“ Backend

A backend API for a life insurance recommendation engine.

## What is this codebase?

This is a Node.js/Express/TypeScript backend for a life insurance recommendation MVP. It provides:

- **User Registration & Login** with JWT authentication and password hashing (bcrypt).
- **Protected Recommendation Endpoint** that accepts user profile data (age, income, dependents, risk tolerance) and returns a personalized life insurance recommendation based on rules-based logic.
- **Validation** of all inputs using Zod schemas.
- **Storage** of all user submissions and recommendations in PostgreSQL via Prisma ORM.
- **Extensible** logic: The recommendation engine is rules-based but can be swapped for ML in the future. All user submissions are stored for analytics and ML training.
